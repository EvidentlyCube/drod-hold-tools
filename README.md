# DROD Hold Tool

This is a tool for inspecting and editing DROD holds, specifically things like:
* Editing texts
* Replacing data
* Changing variable names
* and other operations which don't involve editing actual rooms and puzzles

# How to use

I'll put a link here in the next commit

# Building locally

 * Clone or download the repo
 * Ensure you have `npm` installed
 * Run `npm i` in the directory
 * Run `npm run start` to start the dev server

# Note

The built app is in the `docs` directory. I am too lazy right now to figure out
a better solution than to go with that.
